# Object-Oriented Coffee Machine Simulator

This project is an object-oriented version of a coffee machine simulator written in Python. It uses classes to represent different components of a coffee machine, including the menu, the coffee-making process, and the transactions.

## Features

- Simulate a real-world coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
- Select beverages from a dynamically generated menu based on available recipes.
- Check if the coffee maker has enough resources to make the selected drink.
- Process transactions and handle currency.
- Provide maintenance reports for both the coffee maker and the money machine.

## How to Run the Simulator

To run the coffee machine simulator, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
https://github.com/Yoohoo-cf/oop-virtual-coffee_machine
cd oop-virtual-coffee_machine
```
2. Run the script with Python:
```
python3 main.py
```
3. Interact with the command-line prompts to choose a drink, make a payment, or generate a report.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several files to organize the code based on their responsibilities:

* main.py: The main entry point for the program.
* menu.py: Contains the Menu and MenuItem classes to handle drink options.
* coffee_maker.py: Contains the CoffeeMaker class responsible for making coffee and managing resources.
* money_machine.py: Contains the MoneyMachine class responsible for handling payment transactions.

## Dependencies
This project is built using Python 3 and does not depend on any external libraries.

## Contributing
